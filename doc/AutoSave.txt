DESCRIPTION						*AutoSave-description*

When developing scripts or programs, one frequently switches between a short
edit in Vim and a test or compiler run in a terminal. If one forgets to
persist the changes in Vim (|:w|), that run is of no avail, and one has to
switch back to Vim, save, and repeat.

This plugin allows to designate certain buffers for automatic persistence when
GVIM (and Vim in terminals that support the |FocusLost| event) lose focus, or
optionally also when 'updatetime' passes without a keypress in Vim. With that,
you can just make your edits, switch to another application, and the changes
will have been saved to the file, regardless of whether that file was
currently active inside Vim.

RELATED WORKS								     *

- The |todo.txt| has an entry for an 'autosave' option, which would persist a
  buffer shortly after the last change.
- vim-auto-save (vimscript #4521) automatically persists _all_ (toggled with
  :AutoSaveToggle) buffers on CursorHold events (and reduces 'updatetime' to
  200 ms).
- vim-autosave (https://github.com/chrisbra/vim-autosave) uses Vim 8 timers to
  persist a backup copy every 5 minutes.

USAGE							      *AutoSave-usage*
						     *:AutoSave* *:NoAutoSave*
:AutoSave[!], :NoAutoSave
			Turn on / off automatic saving of the current buffer
			whenever Vim loses focus (in the GUI) or exits; with !
			also on |CursorHold|.
			Note: The saving may trigger |:autocmd|s, and these
			may (depending on your configuration) trigger dialogs,
			or run external commands. If you do not want that,
			either use |:noautocmd| AutoSave (to disable this for
			the current buffer only), or globally by adding that
			to the |g:AutoSave_UpdateModifiers| configuration.

INSTALLATION					       *AutoSave-installation*

The code is hosted in a Git repo at
    https://github.com/inkarkat/vim-AutoSave
You can use your favorite plugin manager, or "git clone" into a directory used
for Vim |packages|. Releases are on the "stable" branch, the latest unstable
development snapshot on "master".

This script is also packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip"
decompressor in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise,
decompress the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by
sourcing the vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim AutoSave*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES					       *AutoSave-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.033 or
  higher.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION					      *AutoSave-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:
						  *g:AutoSave_UpdateModifiers*
The contents of this configuration are prepended to the |:update| command; you
can use |noautocmd| to suppress triggering |autocmd|s, or |silent| to suppress
the save messages: >
    let g:AutoSave_UpdateModifiers = ''
